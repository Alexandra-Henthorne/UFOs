# UFOs

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Dana wants users to be able to use the table and webpage  as one. She is writing the code or alerting it to make sure that users cre able to search multiple criterias at once on the webpage  and create and output that is desirable.


Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

The search criteria are in group items per the code in the index.html.The tables that we are searching or I guess showcasing are Date, City , State, Country, Shape, Duration and Comments . These are  the tables or collumns. When you place a date in the search box it will generate a UFO sighiting.  The column break down the sighting into more detail for instance the state , city and the shape that was seen or recorded.



Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

This was hard and I do not think i even did it right for my index. There are a lot of indents that have to be spot on in order for the code to operate correctly. Missing any of this can offset or make it so your code does not even run properly. I truly do not know what recommendations for the development can be made other than more shortcuts or a way for the programs to interact within one instead of bouncing around.
